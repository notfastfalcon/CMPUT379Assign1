Makefile Targets:
	- all: links to target shell379
	- run: executes the executable shell379
	- shell379: links all object files and creates an executable shell379
	- mainActivity.o: builds the mainActivity object file
	- commandHandler.o: builds the commandHandler object file
	- utility.o: builds the utility object file
	- clean: removes all executables and object files in the current directory.


Code Design:
	1. mainActivity is responsible for booting up, running and shutting down of the shell.
	2. commandHandler is responsible for handling each of the commands in their respective functions. 
	3. utility acts as a supporting code to commandHandler and mainActivity.
	4. This code compiles on lab machines.
